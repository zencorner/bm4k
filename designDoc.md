- Made up of sessions
- Can be organized under program

Exercises (shoot for 1500)
========
- Activities that can be put into a routine with weight and reps, for sets (temp named session).  Exception is cardio, where work is measured in minutes and distance
- Several parent categories {free weight, cables/machines, cardio, bodyweight}
- Sorted by parent category, then by primary muscle used

Session (collection of sets for an exercise)
========
- An exercise that is done for reps, with [x] weight for [y] sets.  The rep range and weight can differ between each set
- An organized list of sessions makes up a routine
- rest timer (optional)

*Progression Charts
===========
- Weight, tracked by date
- Max weight of each exercise, tracked by date
- Cardio tracking where a measure of distance/time is tracked (pace)
- Consistency: Work/rest ratio, how many missed workouts

*Profile

*Today
========
- Starts with a "weigh in" that can happen at any point in the day but will try to recommend weighing in at the same time every day (eg before a workout as most gyms have a scale)
- Sets you up with your preplanned workout if you have scheduled it on the calendar
- OR allows you to choose a routine if you haven't preprogrammed
- Allows you to track your weight and reps as you go through your workout
- concludes with a 'Done' button

Design TODO:
======
- Storage of exercises (how much overhead is reasonable?)
- use cases (first login, programming a routine, daily weigh in, pressing the today button)
